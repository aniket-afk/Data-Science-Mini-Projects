# Data Science Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects and coursework assignments from my data science studies. Topics include probability modeling, simulation, parameter estimation, and image processing. Each subfolder contains a self-contained project or script with code, explanations, and outputs.

**Projects:**
- F1 Grand Prix Probability Modeling:
Calculate winning probabilities for Formula 1 drivers and teams using custom probability distributions and combinatorics.

- Energy Price Distribution Analysis (MLE & Method of Moments):
Analyze and model daily energy prices using histogram fitting, Maximum Likelihood Estimation, and Method of Moments.

- Image Processing (Cartoonize, Compression, Annotation):
Python scripts for image compression, cartoon effect transformation, and adding text overlays using PIL and OpenCV.

- Monthly Rainfall Modeling:
Bayesian modeling of Nashville monthly rainfall using the gamma distribution, including data cleaning and posterior estimation.

- Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm Demo:
Simulation-based estimation of normal distribution parameters via the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm, with visualization of convergence.
