# F1 Grand Prix Probability Modeling

This project analyzes the probability of Formula 1 drivers and teams winning the Qatari Grand Prix (and other races) using a custom probability distribution based on 2023 driver points. It includes code to compute individual win probabilities, joint probabilities for back-to-back wins, and conditional probabilities for different teams. Some real-world problems, like meeting F1 drivers at a fashion show, are also modeled using combinatorics.

**Main features:**
- Custom probability class (`ProbDist`) to model win likelihoods
- Functions to compute event, joint, and conditional probabilities
- Answers to practical F1 questions using probability
- Code is organized for extension or reuse

## How to Run

Requires Python 3.7+ and basic packages (`math`, `pandas`). Just run:
